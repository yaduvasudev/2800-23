##### **About this course**:

This is an introductory course on design and anlysis of algorithms aimed at undergrad students. It assumes a preqrequisite of basic dicrete mathematics and basic data structures and algorithms as seen in the course **[Programming and Data Structures (CS2700/CS2705)](http://cse.iitm.ac.in/course_details.php?arg=ODg=)**. There will be a lot of emphasis on designing provably correct algorithms, and very little on actually writing code for it.
