#### **Grading policy** (tentative)

The course will be evaluated through a series of quizzes and finally the end-sem. I will be releasing problem sets on a weekly basis, and we will have tutorial sessions to discuss the these problems and possible approaches to solving them. The tentative grading scheme is as follows.
- Mini-quizzes: **20%** (best 2/3)
- Quiz 1 & 2: 2 * 20 = **40%**
- End-sem: **40%**
